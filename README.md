### Video: Why theory?

- present use cases for eco-evo theory
- distinguish between three overlapping uses:
    - Theory for conceptual insight (e.g. what processes are important for assembly in ecosystem *x* versus *y*?)
    - Theory for prediction (e.g. how many species will go extinct in the coming century?)
    - Theory for decision making (e.g. given the processes we infer to be at play, how can we reduce extinctions?)

### In class activity: What do you hope to use theory for?

- brainstorm based on the question
- map the interests of the students to the course topics and goals

## Moduel: Start simple

The idea with starting simple (simple means minimally mechanistic models, i.e., island biogeography and neutral theory) is to introduce core processes that can then have more complicated mechanisms layered on top of them.

### Video: The theory of island biogeography

- present the standard island biogeography theory (IBT)
- why it was revolutionary (i.e. made predictions for the first time in a science that was generally more descriptive)
- discuss ["the complicated legacy of e.o. wilson"](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-complicated-legacy-of-e-o-wilson/)


### In class activity: The theory of island biogeography

- explore IBT predictions (with RoLE??) 
- discuss complicated legacies in science


### Video: The neutral theory of biodiversity 

- build from IBT to neutral theory of biodiversity (NTB)


### In class activity: The theory of island biogeography

- explore TIB predictions (with RoLE??)
- discuss complicated legacies in science
