# Solving biodiversity paradoxes by exploring deeper time patterns {#intro_evo}

## Temporal dynamics can help distinguish ecological processes

## Ecological processes derive from evolutionary processes

Talk especially about trait differences leading to fitness and competitive differences in ecological theory

## Evolutionar processes derive from ecological processes

Talk about hypotheses about evolutionary character displacement

## Prelude: how can we model eco-evolutionary feedbacks?
